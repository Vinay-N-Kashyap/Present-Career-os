          'In modern corporate automation architecture, business processes exist on a spectrum between deterministic rules and probabilistic judgment.',
          'Robotic Process Automation (RPA) represents deterministic workflow execution. Software "bots" emulate human desktop interactions: clicking UI buttons, reading structured Excel spreadsheets, scraping web portals, and entering data into legacy SAP or Oracle ERP screens. RPA bots follow strict, branching `if-then-else` decision trees. If a screen layout shifts or an unexpected pop-up appears, an RPA bot throws an exception and halts.',
          'Cognitive AI Agents, by contrast, incorporate machine learning and Large Language Models to process unstructured data (such as ambiguous customer dispute emails, legal contracts, or handwritten receipts). AI agents use probabilistic inference to classify intent, extract semantic entities, and recommend actions.',
