/**
 * 1-Month Python course (course-python-backend): from a first print() to a small web API online.
 *
 * Week 1: Python basics. Week 2: working with data (lists, dictionaries). Week 3: building
 * programs (modules, files, JSON, classes, testing). Week 4: Git, the month project, web APIs,
 * debugging, deploying and interview practice.
 *
 * Month project: an Expense Tracker (add expenses, see totals by category, save them, then serve
 * them from a small FastAPI web API).
 * Practice tasks are small Python functions checked with assert. They never use input(), because
 * the browser cannot type into a running program; input() is taught for the laptop on Day 20.
 *
 * Quest ids (python-lecture1/exam/assign-day-N) are unchanged, so saved progress stays valid.
