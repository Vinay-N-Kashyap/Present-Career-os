          "Distributed event streaming platforms discard the traditional mutable database model where records are modified in place.",
          "In a conventional relational database or document store, updating a user record overwrites existing disk blocks and requires complex locking mechanisms.",
          "These in-place mutations introduce write amplification, concurrency contention, lock escalation, and complex transaction log write-ahead overhead.",
          "In contrast, an event streaming log enforces a strict append-only invariant where new events can only be written to the physical tail of the log.",
          "Once written and flushed to durable storage, historical event records are completely immutable and can never be altered or retracted in place.",
          "Immutability fundamentally transforms concurrency because writers only ever touch the current end of the file while readers freely scan history without locks.",
          "This architectural separation allows hundreds of concurrent consumers to read identical log streams simultaneously without blocking incoming high-speed producer writes.",
          "Furthermore, an immutable stream of atomic facts preserves the full chronological trajectory of system state rather than merely the latest snapshot.",
          "By treating state as a pure mathematical fold over an append-only event log, distributed systems achieve unprecedented auditability and operational resilience."
