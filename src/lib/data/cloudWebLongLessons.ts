          "If an unpatched OpenSSL vulnerability emerges in your Linux kernel, your operations team must apply the corresponding security patch across your entire server fleet.",
          "AWS assumes no responsibility for customer operating system vulnerabilities, guest network firewall configurations, or corrupt runtime binaries on IaaS nodes.",
