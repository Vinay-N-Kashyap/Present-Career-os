          "When a corporate rebranding or design refresh occurs, developers are forced to manually find and replace hardcoded values, leading to visual regressions and inconsistencies.",
          "To solve this systemic maintenance crisis, modern design systems organize tokens into a strict three-tier hierarchical architecture.",
          "Tier 1 consists of Global or Primitive Tokens, which define raw, context-agnostic values such as 'blue-500: #3b82f6' or 'font-sans: Inter'.",
          "Tier 2 introduces Semantic Alias Tokens, which map raw primitives to specific design purposes such as 'color-interactive-primary: var(--blue-500)'.",
          "Tier 3 contains Component-Scoped Tokens, which bind semantic aliases to specific UI components such as 'button-primary-bg: var(--color-interactive-primary)'.",
          "This tripartite separation ensures that product themes, dark modes, and brand updates can be applied effortlessly without touching individual component implementation logic.",

          "In HSL, Hue is an angle on the color wheel from 0 to 360 degrees, Saturation is color intensity from 0 to 100 percent, and Lightness ranges from 0 percent pure black to 100 percent pure white.",
          "Design systems construct tonal color ramps ranging from 50 (ultra-light tints for backgrounds) to 900 or 950 (ultra-dark shades for text and borders).",
          "By fixing the Hue and Saturation while systematically adjusting the Lightness percentage in stepped increments, teams produce balanced palettes.",
          "For example, a primary brand hue of 220 degrees with 90 percent saturation can yield step 50 at 96 percent lightness, step 500 at 50 percent lightness, and step 900 at 15 percent lightness.",
