          "Integrity ensures that system information remains completely accurate, authentic, and protected against unauthorized modification or deletion.",
          "Availability mandates that authorized principals maintain timely, dependable, and unimpeded access to computing resources, networks, and services.",
          "A secure software system cannot optimize exclusively for one pillar while neglecting the others without introducing catastrophic business risks.",
          "For example, encrypting a database to achieve confidentiality is futile if an unhandled denial-of-service attack wipes out system availability.",

          "Security engineers continually analyze business workflows to balance these three competing constraints against operational performance and user friction.",
