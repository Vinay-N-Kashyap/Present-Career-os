        [
            "When Kubernetes scales down a deployment or performs a rolling update, it initiates container termination by sending a POSIX SIGTERM signal to the main process.",
            "If an application terminates abruptly upon receiving SIGTERM, all in-flight HTTP requests and database transactions are severed, resulting in dropped client connections and 502 Bad Gateway errors.",
            "A graceful shutdown handler intercepts the SIGTERM signal, transitions the pod's readiness probe to failing (HTTP 503), and stops accepting new incoming connections.",
            "The application then allows a configured grace period (such as 15 or 30 seconds) for existing in-flight requests to complete execution and commit transactions cleanly.",
            "Engineering robust signal handling ensures that microservices achieve zero-downtime rolling updates without dropping a single user transaction."

        # Part 4: Connection Draining & TCP Keep-Alive
        [
            "During rolling deployments, ingress load balancers and Kubernetes kube-proxy require several seconds to update iptables rules and remove terminating pods from routing tables.",
            "Because load balancers may continue forwarding new TCP connections for a brief window after SIGTERM, terminating pods must continue serving new requests during this buffer.",
            "Furthermore, clients utilizing HTTP persistent keep-alive connections will continue reusing existing open sockets unless the server explicitly closes them.",
            "During graceful draining, the server sends 'Connection: close' headers on all response messages, signaling clients and proxies to gracefully terminate persistent sockets.",
            "Coordinating connection draining with Kubernetes termination grace periods prevents race conditions and ensures smooth traffic handover to newly launched pods."

            "The service smoothly transitions readiness state, drains in-flight requests within the configured timeout window, and completes clean resource teardown with zero dropped connections.",
            "Throughout the entire deployment sequence, synthetic client requests achieve a 100% success rate with zero 502 Bad Gateway or connection reset errors.",
